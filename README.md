# Spring-Design-Project
Welcome to our spring design project. This website is designed to help students from TJHSST find carpools easily!
Just register using your TJHSST login and password, and you're in. You can create your own pool, entering the number
of pool members, the start and finish location, and the depart and arrival time. If you have further questions on a specific carpool,
you can find the contact info of each member in the pool (typically their phone number). If some event pops up,
you can remove yourself from the pool. Happy car pooling!
